# Description
Just some code for a senior year (undergrad) research project. It is built to test various activation functions on a perceptron program designed by yours truly. I'm always up for constructive criticism.

Branch Tree:
  - main
    - sigmoid_func: Most of the code documentation is here. This is also the code for the sigmoid logistic function.
    - hyperbolic_func: This is the code for the hyperbolic tangent function.
    - ReLU_func: This is the code for the rectified linear unit function.
